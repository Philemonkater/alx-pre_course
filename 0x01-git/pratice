#When you delete a file or directory locally, Git doesn’t know about it until you tell Git and then push the change. So if you deleted a folder locally, but haven’t committed and pushed the deletion, GitHub won’t reflect that change.

#To remove the directory from the GitHub repository:
#Check the status (you'll see deleted files listed):
git status

#Stage the deletion:
git add -A
#The -A flag stages deletions, modifications, and additions.

#Commit the change:
git commit -m "Delete directory"

#Push the changes to GitHub:
git push

#Once you push the commit, the directory should be removed from GitHub
